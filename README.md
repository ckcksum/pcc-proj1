# Alien Invasion
This is my solution to the Python Crash Course Part II Project 1, Alien Invasion.

## Planning
- **Player**: controls the rocket ship at the bottom center 
  - arrow key: ship to right/left
  - spacebar: shoot bullets
- **A fleet of aliens**: 
  - Fills the sky and moves across and down the screen at the start of the game.
  - All aliens are destroyed: a new and faster fleet appears
- **Losing a ship** :
    - If an alien hits the ship
    - If an alien reaches the bottom of the screen
- **Game end**: Player loses 3 ships
